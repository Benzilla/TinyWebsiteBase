	<h1>Tiny Projects</h1>
	<p>Hello, I'm Ben. I'm a <a href="https://stokesy.io" target="_blank">full stack developer</a> and entrepreneur who's started an <a href="https://rippleandroll.com" target="_blank">ice cream business</a> and <a href="https://cheekydough.com" target="_blank">cookie dough business</a> amongst other things.</p>
	<p>Probably like you, I'm that person who is constantly coming up with lots of little project ideas. Whether that be ideas for apps, websites, games, businesses; whatever. I have them all stored on a list in my phone, and I know you probably have one of those lists too.</p>
	<p>The problem is I never seem to get round to completing them, or even starting them for that matter. The list just grows bigger and bigger.</p>
	<p>Not completing any of these ideas comes with a few problems:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The list grows bigger and more daunting</li>
		<li>I feel like a failure because I'm not completing anything</li>
		<li>Missing out on exploring cool ideas with massive potential</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The goal of this website is to try and explore as many of these ideas as I can. I'm not one for new year's resolutions, but I do seem to get into a habit of setting goals around my birthday. I turned 25 on May 17th 2020, and my goal for my 25th year on earth is to try at least one of these tiny project ideas a week and see what happens. If they can make some money too, that'd be great.</p>
	<p>You can check up on my progress on my <a href="/projects">projects</a> page.</p>
